    /**
     * Element class mixin that provides meta-programming for Polymer's template
     * binding and data observation (collectively, "property effects") system.
     *
     * This mixin uses provides the following key static methods for adding
     * property effects to an element class:
     * - `addPropertyEffect`
     * - `createPropertyObserver`
     * - `createMethodObserver`
     * - `createNotifyingProperty`
     * - `createReadOnlyProperty`
     * - `createReflectedProperty`
     * - `createComputedProperty`
     * - `bindTemplate`
     *
     * Each method creates one or more property accessors, along with metadata
     * used by this mixin's implementation of `_propertiesChanged` to perform
     * the property effects.
     *
     * Underscored versions of the above methods also exist on the element
     * prototype for adding property effects on instances at runtime.
     *
     * Note that this mixin overrides several `PropertyAccessors` methods, in
     * many cases to maintain guarantees provided by the Polymer 1.x features;
     * notably it changes property accessors to be synchronous by default
     * whereas the default when using `PropertyAccessors` standalone is to be
     * async by default.
     *
